Simple use of Discord WebHooks

## Two ways to send message

#### 1 - With Discord API (Working)
    The message will be send using a POST in Axios by Discord API
#### 2 - With Discord.js (Bug)
    The message will be send using a package discord.js, actually not working because need node version 12+.
    I will fix this.
